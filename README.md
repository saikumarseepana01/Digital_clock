# Theme Clock

This project is a simple theme-based clock with a toggle button for switching between light and dark modes. The clock displays the current time and date dynamically.

## Features
- Analog clock with hour, minute, and second hands
- Digital time and date display
- Light and dark mode toggle
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the clock and UI elements
- **CSS**: Styling, animations, and theme switching
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic time updates and event handling

## Files Included
- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the clock structure
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the clock and implementing themes
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for handling time updates and theme toggling

## Setup Instructions
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Click the "Dark mode" button to switch themes.

## How It Works
- The JavaScript script updates the clock hands and digital display every second.
- The theme toggle button adds or removes a `dark` class from the `html` element to switch styles.
- The `scale` function is used to map time values to rotation angles.
